## 🚀 Quick Start

This project supports **two build flavors** to accommodate different use cases:

- **🤖 Pepper Flavor** - Full application with all robot features (navigation, gestures, sensors, robot camera)
- **📱 Standalone Flavor** - Runs on any Android device for testing conversational AI without robot hardware

Both flavors share the same core conversational AI system but differ in hardware integration. The standalone version uses stub implementations for robot-specific features and your device's camera instead of Pepper's camera.

### Requirements

#### For Pepper Robot (Full Functionality)
- **Target Robot**: Pepper v1.8 running NAOqi OS 2.9.5
- **Required IDE**: Android Studio (latest stable version recommended)
- **Build Configuration**:
  - Gradle: `8.13`
  - Android Gradle Plugin: `8.13.0`
  - CompileSdk / TargetSdk: `35`
  - MinSdk: `23` (Android 6.0)
  - Java Version: `17`
- **API Keys**: For full functionality, API keys for various services are required (see "Configure API Keys" section below)

#### For Standalone Mode (Testing on any Android Device)
- **Target Device**: Any Android device running Android 6.0+ (API 23+)
- **IDE**: Android Studio (latest stable version recommended)
- **Build Configuration**: Same as above
- **Purpose**: Test conversational AI, tool system, and generic features without robot hardware
- **Limitations**: Robot-specific features (navigation, gestures, camera, sensors) are simulated with log output

### Modern Development Without the Plugin
This project uses modern Android Studio versions **without** the deprecated Pepper SDK plugin. The plugin is no longer maintained and incompatible with recent Android Studio versions. Instead, we configure the project manually following the approach documented here: **[Pepper with Android Studio in 2024](https://github.com/unitedroboticsgroup-france/MyPepperApplication)**. This enables the use of the latest Android Studio versions, modern AndroidX libraries, Java 17 language features, and the latest Gradle and build tools with improved IDE performance.

**Note on API 23 (Android 6.0) Compatibility:**
Pepper v1.8 runs Android 6.0 (API Level 23). This limits some third-party libraries to older versions, as many newer releases require Android 8.0+ (API 26+) for features like `java.util.Base64` and `MethodHandle`. Despite this constraint, the project uses the latest compatible versions of all dependencies and modern development tools (Gradle 8.13, Java 17, Android Studio latest).

## ⚙️ Core Features & System Capabilities

<a id="voice-input"></a>
## 🎙️ Voice Input & Language System

The app provides comprehensive voice input and multilingual capabilities with two speech recognition modes and intelligent language handling.

### Audio Input Modes

The app supports **two speech recognition modes**, configurable in **Settings → Audio Input**:

#### 1. Realtime API Audio (Default) ✨
- **Simple Setup** - No separate speech API key needed
- **Lower Latency** - Integrated audio processing with conversation flow
- **Server VAD** - Automatic speech detection handled by the model
- **Async Transcripts** - User speech transcripts appear after responses start
- **Direct Audio Processing** - Model processes audio directly for responses
- **Note**: The displayed transcript may not exactly match what the model understood, as transcription is generated asynchronously
- **Best For** - English and major languages, quick setup

#### 2. Azure Speech Services (Recommended for some low resource languages)
- **Superior Quality** - Significantly better for regional dialects and low-resource languages
- **Continuous Recognition** - For optimal latency, transcription happens while speaking (not after), with interim results displayed in status bar
- **Confidence Scores** - Real-time feedback on transcription quality
- **Specialized Models** - Language-specific optimization for regional variants
- **Sync Transcripts** - User speech appears immediately in chat
- **Full Transparency** - The exact transcribed text is sent to the model (what you see = what the model receives)
- **Azure VAD** - Voice activity detection handled by Azure Speech Services
- **Configurable Silence Timeout** - End-of-speech detection after silence (default: 500ms, adjustable in settings)
- **Requires** - `AZURE_SPEECH_KEY` in `local.properties`
- **Best For** - Some low-resource languages, production use, debugging

#### Switching Audio Modes
1. Open app **Settings** (tap wrench icon 🔧 in toolbar or swipe from right edge)
2. Select **Audio Input** dropdown
3. Choose preferred mode:
   - **"Realtime API (Simple Setup)"** - Default, no extra keys
   - **"Azure Speech (Best for Dialects)"** - Requires Azure Speech key
4. Close settings - change takes effect immediately

### ASR Confidence System

**Note**: Only available in **Azure Speech mode**. The app uses intelligent confidence scoring to ensure accurate voice input processing.

#### How It Works
- **Confidence Analysis** - Each recognized speech gets a confidence score (0-100%)
- **Smart Tagging** - Speech below the configured threshold gets tagged with "[Low confidence: XX%]"
- **AI Model Awareness** - The AI can identify uncertain transcriptions and ask for clarification
- **Adjustable Settings** - Users can customize the minimum confidence level in settings (default: 70%)

#### Benefits
- **Intelligent Clarification** - AI can ask "Did you say X?" or "Can you repeat?" when transcription is uncertain
- **Context Awareness** - AI knows when to be more careful about interpreting unclear speech
- **Customizable Sensitivity** - Users can adjust based on their environment and speaking style  
- **Better Understanding** - AI can handle ambiguous transcriptions more gracefully

### Multilingual Support

#### AI Response Languages
- **Universal Language Support** - The Realtime API can respond in any language, including regional dialects
- **Instant Language Switching** - The AI can switch languages mid-conversation when requested by the user or specified in the system prompt
- **Contextual Language Use** - AI automatically adapts to the user's preferred language based on conversation context

#### Speech Recognition Languages

The app supports **30+ languages** in both audio input modes:

**Realtime API Mode:**
- Language setting affects the **input audio transcription** (Whisper-based) that appears in chat
- Does NOT affect what the model understands (model processes audio directly with automatic language detection)
- Transcription quality improves when correct language is configured

**Azure Speech Mode:**
- Language setting is **critical** - directly affects what text is sent to the model
- Must match the spoken language for accurate recognition

**Supported languages** (both modes):

- **German variants**: de-DE (Germany), de-AT (Austria), de-CH (Switzerland)
- **English variants**: en-US, en-GB, en-AU, en-CA
- **French variants**: fr-FR (France), fr-CA (Canada), fr-CH (Switzerland)
- **Italian variants**: it-IT (Italy), it-CH (Switzerland)
- **Spanish variants**: es-ES (Spain), es-AR (Argentina), es-MX (Mexico)
- **Portuguese variants**: pt-BR (Brazil), pt-PT (Portugal)
- **Chinese variants**: zh-CN (Mandarin Simplified), zh-HK (Cantonese Traditional), zh-TW (Taiwanese Mandarin)
- **Asian languages**: ja-JP (Japanese), ko-KR (Korean)
- **European languages**: nl-NL (Dutch), nb-NO (Norwegian), sv-SE (Swedish), da-DK (Danish)
- **Other languages**: ru-RU (Russian), ar-AE/ar-SA (Arabic)

#### Language Configuration
- **Settings Control** - Recognition language can be changed in app settings
- **Live Switching** - Language changes take effect immediately during active sessions
- **No App Restart** - System reconfigures automatically

#### Important Language Considerations

**Realtime API Mode:**
- ✅ Model understands speech via automatic language detection (no configuration required)
- ⚙️ Language setting improves displayed **transcript quality** (Whisper-based)
- 💡 Recommendation: Configure correct language for better transcripts, but not strictly necessary

**Azure Speech Mode:**
- ⚠️ Language setting is **critical** - must match spoken language
- Users must speak in the configured recognition language for accurate transcription
- If user speaks in different language than configured, recognition will fail or be very poor
- 💡 Recommendation: Always change language setting before switching spoken languages

**AI Response Language:**
- ✅ AI can respond in any language regardless of input mode or language setting

#### Usage Examples
```bash
# System prompt in English, but AI can respond in other languages when requested
User (English): "Please respond in German from now on"
AI (German): "Gerne! Ab jetzt spreche ich auf Deutsch mit dir."

# User must change recognition language in settings to speak German
User: (Changes settings to de-DE, then speaks German)
"Erzähl mir einen Witz"
AI: "Gerne! Hier ist ein Witz für dich..."
```

## 🎛️ Interruption Handling System

Due to Pepper's hardware limitations (no echo cancellation), the app uses an intelligent microphone management system to prevent the robot from hearing itself while ensuring users can still interrupt ongoing responses.

### Microphone Management
- **Closed During Speech** - Microphone automatically closes when Pepper is speaking or processing
- **Open During Listening** - Microphone only active when waiting for user input
- **Hardware Constraint** - Necessary because Pepper's older hardware lacks echo cancellation

### Status Bar Interruption Controls
- **First Tap** (during robot speech) - Immediately stops current response, clears audio queue, cancels generation, AND mutes microphone ("Muted — tap to unmute" status)
- **Second Tap** (when muted) - Unmutes and returns to listening mode

### Automatic Response Interruption
Certain events automatically interrupt ongoing responses to provide immediate feedback:
- **Touch Events** - Physical touch triggers new contextual response
- **Navigation Updates** - Status messages like "[MAP LOADED]" or "[NAVIGATION ERROR]"
- **Game Events** - Memory game matches, quiz answers, etc.
- **System Messages** - Tool execution results and status updates

### Technical Features
- **Instant Stop** - Responses halt immediately when interrupted
- **Queue Management** - Audio buffers cleared to prevent delayed playback
- **State Coordination** - Turn management ensures proper microphone timing
- **Seamless Recovery** - Smooth transition back to listening mode

## 🗺️ Navigation Workflow

### Complete Setup Process

#### 1. Create Environment Map
```bash
User: "Create a map of this room"
Robot: "I have started mapping. I have cleared 3 existing locations (printer, kitchen, entrance) since they would be invalid with the new map coordinate system. Guide me through the room..."
```

**Note**: Creating a new map automatically deletes all existing saved locations since they become invalid with the new coordinate system.

#### 2. Guide Pepper Through the Room
```bash
User: "Move forward 2 meters"
User: "Turn right 90 degrees"  
User: "Move forward 1 meter"
# Continue exploring all areas you want mapped
```

#### 3. Save Important Locations
```bash
User: "Save this location as printer"
Robot: "Saved location 'printer' with high precision during mapping"

User: "Save this location as kitchen" 
Robot: "Saved location 'kitchen' with high precision during mapping"
```

#### 4. Finish Mapping
```bash
User: "Finish the map"
Robot: "Map completed and saved successfully. Ready for navigation!"
```

**⚠️ Important**: Pepper should be at the **same position** where mapping was started when finishing the map. This ensures accurate localization.

#### 5. Navigate to Saved Locations
```bash
User: "Go to the printer"
Robot: "Navigating to printer... I have arrived at printer."

User: "Navigate to kitchen"
Robot: "Navigating to kitchen (high-precision location)..."
```

### Smart Location Recognition
The AI automatically knows all available locations and can suggest corrections:

```bash
User: "Go to dorm"
Robot: "I have these locations: Door, Kitchen, Printer. Did you mean 'Door'?"

User: "Yes, door" 
Robot: "Navigating to door..."
```

### Key Features
- **🎯 High-Precision Locations**: Saved during mapping for maximum accuracy
- **🧠 Intelligent Suggestions**: AI suggests similar location names
- **📍 Persistent Storage**: Locations survive app restarts within the same map
- **⚡ Dynamic Updates**: AI knows new locations immediately
- **🛡️ Error Prevention**: No "location not found" errors
- **🗑️ Auto-Cleanup**: New maps automatically clear old locations to prevent confusion

### Localization Best Practices
**⚠️ Critical for Successful Localization:**
- When **finishing a map**: Pepper should be at the same position where mapping started
- When **loading a saved map** (after app restart): Place Pepper at the same starting position as when the map was created
- If Pepper is not at the starting position during localization, orientation may fail or take significantly longer
- The starting position serves as the reference point for the entire coordinate system

**Key Flow Characteristics:**
- **Model Flexibility**: Supports gpt-realtime (GA), gpt-realtime-mini, gpt-4o-realtime-preview, gpt-4o-mini-realtime-preview
- **Dual Audio Input**: Realtime API (simple) or Azure Speech (dialect quality)
- **Server-side VAD**: Realtime API handles turn detection automatically
- **Conditional Tool Calls**: AI decides when tools are needed (not every response uses tools)
- **Direct Responses**: Simple queries get immediate audio responses without tool execution
- **Streaming Function Calls**: Tool call deltas assembled in real-time when needed
- **Synchronous Execution**: Tools run immediately, results sent back
- **Audio Streaming**: TTS audio played as it arrives (low latency)
- **Gesture Coordination**: Animations triggered alongside speech

## 🛠️ Development

### SDK Architecture & Extensibility

This application makes extensive use of **Pepper Android SDK (QiSDK)** high-level functions for robot control, navigation, perception, and interaction. The QiSDK provides a modern, Java-based API that integrates seamlessly with Android development.

#### SDK Limitations & Extension Possibilities

**QiSDK Limitations:**
- Limited to high-level abstractions (navigation, gestures, perception)
- No direct access to low-level robot functions available in the older NAOqi SDK
- Some advanced robot capabilities (e.g., low-level motor control, direct sensor access) are not exposed

**Extension via SSH:**
- The app performs an **SSH connection test** to the robot's head at startup
- This SSH connection provides a path for developers to access **low-level NAOqi functions** if needed
- Developers can extend the app with custom SSH-based commands to:
  - Access sensors not exposed in QiSDK
  - Implement low-level motor control
  - Integrate custom NAOqi modules
  - Debug and monitor system-level robot state

**Development Approach:**
- **Primary**: Use QiSDK high-level functions for all standard features (recommended for stability and maintainability)
- **Advanced**: Use SSH/NAOqi for specialized low-level requirements when QiSDK is insufficient

This hybrid approach provides both the convenience of modern Android development and the flexibility of low-level robot access when needed.

### Gesture Synchronization During Speech

**Challenge:**
When using external TTS audio (Realtime API or Azure Speech), Pepper's built-in gesture generation system does not activate automatically. The robot's native TTS system typically generates synchronized gestures, but this integration is lost when streaming audio from external sources.

**Solution:**
The app implements a **gesture animation loop** that runs during speech output:
- **Random Explanatory Gestures**: A selection of appropriate "explaining" gestures (body talk animations) are played in a continuous loop
- **Duration-Based**: Gestures run for the entire duration of the audio playback
- **Natural Movement**: Creates the impression of natural communication through continuous body language
- **Non-Repetitive**: Random selection prevents robotic, repetitive patterns

**Implementation:**
- Gestures start when audio playback begins
- Loop continues until speech output completes
- Animation selection from Pepper's built-in gesture library
- Synchronized with turn management to prevent overlap

This approach provides natural-looking robot behavior even when using external audio sources, maintaining the illusion of integrated speech and movement.

### Key Configuration Files
- `local.properties.example` - API key template
- `app/build.gradle` - Build configuration and key injection
- `app/src/main/assets/jokes.json` - Joke database

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Not connected to server"
- Check your OpenAI or Azure OpenAI API key and endpoint
- Verify internet connectivity
- For Azure: Ensure the deployment name matches your Azure setup

#### "Vision analysis not available"
- Vision works automatically with gpt-realtime model
- For Groq alternative: Add GROQ_API_KEY to `local.properties`
- Check camera permissions and robot focus

#### "Feature requires API key"
- Each feature shows helpful setup instructions
- Add the corresponding API key to `local.properties`
- Rebuild and reinstall the app

#### Navigation Issues

**"No map available for navigation"**
- Create an environment map first using "Create a map"
- Guide Pepper through the room completely
- Finish the mapping process with "Finish the map"

**"Location not found"** 
- The AI now suggests available locations automatically
- Check spelling and pronunciation of location names
- Use the suggested location names from the AI

**"Mapping timeout"**
- Ensure room has good lighting and visual features
- Avoid rooms with mostly blank walls or mirrors
- Try mapping smaller sections of large rooms
- Check for obstacles blocking Pepper's movement

**"High precision vs standard locations"**
- Locations saved during active mapping are most accurate
- Locations saved after mapping are less precise but still functional
- For best results, save important locations during the mapping process

**"My saved locations disappeared"**
- Creating a new map automatically deletes all existing locations
- This prevents navigation errors caused by incompatible coordinate systems
- Each map creates its own coordinate system, making old locations invalid
- Simply re-save your important locations after creating the new map

### Logging
The app provides detailed logs for debugging:
```bash
# View all logs
adb logcat | grep -E "(ChatActivity|ApiKeyManager|ToolExecutor)"

# View navigation logs specifically
adb logcat | grep -E "(MovementController|ToolExecutor.*navigate|ToolRegistry.*location)"

# View mapping logs
adb logcat | grep -E "(LocalizeAndMap|mapping|create_environment_map)"
```
