### Modern Development Without the Plugin
This project uses modern Android Studio versions **without** the deprecated Pepper SDK plugin. The plugin is no longer maintained and incompatible with recent Android Studio versions. Instead, we configure the project manually following the approach documented here: **[Pepper with Android Studio in 2024](https://github.com/unitedroboticsgroup-france/MyPepperApplication)**.

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Use latest Android Studio versions
- ✅ Modern AndroidX libraries
- ✅ Java 17 language features
- ✅ Latest Gradle and build tools
- ✅ Better IDE performance and features

**Note on API 23 (Android 6.0) Compatibility:**
Pepper v1.8 runs Android 6.0 (API Level 23). This limits some third-party libraries to older versions, as many newer releases require Android 8.0+ (API 26+) for features like `java.util.Base64` and `MethodHandle`. Despite this constraint, the project uses the latest compatible versions of all dependencies and modern development tools (Gradle 8.13, Java 17, Android Studio latest).

### 1. Clone and Configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[ANONYMIZED]/pepper-realtime-conversation.git
cd pepper-realtime-conversation
```

**Create configuration file:**
- Copy `local.properties.example` to `local.properties` in the project root directory
- **Important:** If you create `local.properties` manually, you must add your Android SDK path at the top:
  ```properties
  sdk.dir=C\:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk
  ```
  (Android Studio adds this automatically when you sync the project)

### 2. Configure API Keys

Edit `local.properties` and add your API keys. See the **[API Key Setup](#-api-key-setup)** section below for detailed instructions on obtaining these keys.

```properties
# REALTIME API PROVIDERS (Choose one or configure both)

### Technical Details
- **QiSDK Integration** - Uses Pepper's built-in human awareness
- **Real-time Processing** - Efficient polling system (1.5s intervals)
- **Resource Management** - Automatically stops monitoring when hidden
- **Thread-Safe** - Handles concurrent data updates safely

## 👋 Touch Interaction

Pepper responds to physical touch on various sensors. When touched, the AI receives context and can respond naturally in conversation.

### Available Touch Sensors
- **🧠 Head Touch** - Touch the top of Pepper's head
- **🤲 Hand Touch** - Touch either left or right hand  
- **⚡ Bumper Sensors** - Front left, front right, and back bumper sensors

### Features
- **Contextual AI Integration** - Touch events like "[User touched my head]" are sent to AI for natural responses
- **Debounce Protection** - 500ms delay prevents multiple rapid touches
- **Smart Pausing** - Automatically pauses during navigation/localization

## 🎛️ Interruption Handling System

Due to Pepper's hardware limitations (no echo cancellation), the app uses an intelligent microphone management system to prevent the robot from hearing itself while ensuring users can still interrupt ongoing responses.

### Microphone Management
- **Closed During Speech** - Microphone automatically closes when Pepper is speaking or processing
- **Open During Listening** - Microphone only active when waiting for user input
- **Hardware Constraint** - Necessary because Pepper's older hardware lacks echo cancellation

### Status Bar Interruption Controls
- **First Tap** (during robot speech) - Immediately stops current response, clears audio queue, cancels generation, AND mutes microphone ("Muted — tap to unmute" status)
- **Second Tap** (when muted) - Unmutes and returns to listening mode

### Automatic Response Interruption
Certain events automatically interrupt ongoing responses to provide immediate feedback:
- **Touch Events** - Physical touch triggers new contextual response
- **Navigation Updates** - Status messages like "[MAP LOADED]" or "[NAVIGATION ERROR]"
- **Game Events** - Memory game matches, quiz answers, etc.
- **System Messages** - Tool execution results and status updates

### Technical Features
- **Instant Stop** - Responses halt immediately when interrupted
- **Queue Management** - Audio buffers cleared to prevent delayed playback
- **State Coordination** - Turn management ensures proper microphone timing
- **Seamless Recovery** - Smooth transition back to listening mode

## 🎙️ Audio Input Modes

The app supports **two speech recognition modes**, configurable in **Settings → Audio Input**:

### 1. Realtime API Audio (Default) ✨
- **Simple Setup** - No separate speech API key needed
- **Lower Latency** - Integrated audio processing with conversation flow
- **Server VAD** - Automatic speech detection handled by the model
- **Async Transcripts** - User speech transcripts appear after responses start
- **Best For** - English and major languages, quick setup

### 2. Azure Speech Services (Recommended for Dialects)
- **Superior Quality** - Significantly better for regional dialects and low-resource languages
- **Confidence Scores** - Real-time feedback on transcription quality
- **Specialized Models** - Language-specific optimization for regional variants
- **Sync Transcripts** - User speech appears immediately in chat
- **Requires** - `AZURE_SPEECH_KEY` in `local.properties`
- **Best For** - Regional dialects, low-resource languages, production use

### Switching Audio Modes
1. Open app **Settings** (three-line menu icon)
2. Select **Audio Input** dropdown
3. Choose preferred mode:
   - **"Realtime API (Simple Setup)"** - Default, no extra keys
   - **"Azure Speech (Best for Dialects)"** - Requires Azure Speech key
4. Close settings - change takes effect immediately

## 🎤 ASR Confidence System

**Note**: Only available in **Azure Speech mode**. The app uses intelligent confidence scoring to ensure accurate voice input processing.

### How It Works
- **Confidence Analysis** - Each recognized speech gets a confidence score (0-100%)
- **Smart Tagging** - Speech below the configured threshold gets tagged with "[Low confidence: XX%]"
- **AI Model Awareness** - The AI can identify uncertain transcriptions and ask for clarification
- **Adjustable Settings** - Users can customize the minimum confidence level in settings (default: 70%)

### Benefits
- **Intelligent Clarification** - AI can ask "Did you say X?" or "Can you repeat?" when transcription is uncertain
- **Context Awareness** - AI knows when to be more careful about interpreting unclear speech
- **Customizable Sensitivity** - Users can adjust based on their environment and speaking style  
- **Better Understanding** - AI can handle ambiguous transcriptions more gracefully

## 🌍 Multilingual Support

The app provides comprehensive multilingual capabilities with intelligent language handling for both speech recognition and AI responses.

### AI Response Languages
- **Universal Language Support** - The Realtime API can respond in any language, including regional dialects
- **Instant Language Switching** - The AI can switch languages mid-conversation when requested by the user or specified in the system prompt
- **Contextual Language Use** - AI automatically adapts to the user's preferred language based on conversation context

### Speech Recognition Languages

**Note**: Language selection applies to **Azure Speech mode only**. Realtime API mode uses server-side language detection.

When using **Azure Speech mode**, the app supports **30+ languages** with superior accuracy for European languages and dialects:

- **German variants**: de-DE (Germany), de-AT (Austria), de-CH (Switzerland)
- **English variants**: en-US, en-GB, en-AU, en-CA
- **French variants**: fr-FR (France), fr-CA (Canada), fr-CH (Switzerland)
- **Italian variants**: it-IT (Italy), it-CH (Switzerland)
- **Spanish variants**: es-ES (Spain), es-AR (Argentina), es-MX (Mexico)
- **Portuguese variants**: pt-BR (Brazil), pt-PT (Portugal)
- **Chinese variants**: zh-CN (Mandarin Simplified), zh-HK (Cantonese Traditional), zh-TW (Taiwanese Mandarin)
- **Asian languages**: ja-JP (Japanese), ko-KR (Korean)
- **European languages**: nl-NL (Dutch), nb-NO (Norwegian), sv-SE (Swedish), da-DK (Danish)
- **Other languages**: ru-RU (Russian), ar-AE/ar-SA (Arabic)

#### Language Configuration
- **Settings Control** - Recognition language can be changed in app settings
- **Live Switching** - Language changes take effect immediately during active sessions
- **No App Restart** - Speech recognizer reconfigures automatically

### Important Language Considerations
- **Recognition vs. Response** - Users must speak in the configured recognition language, but AI can respond in any language
- **Language Mismatch Handling** - If user speaks in different language than configured, recognition accuracy will be poor
- **Recommendation** - Change recognition language in settings before switching spoken languages

### Why Two Audio Modes?
The app offers **both Realtime API and Azure Speech** to balance simplicity and quality:

**Realtime API Mode** (Default):
- Simpler setup - works with just OpenAI key
- Lower latency - integrated audio pipeline
- Good for English and major languages

**Azure Speech Mode** (Optional):
- Superior accuracy for regional dialects and variants
- Language-specific models optimized for regional variants
- Confidence scoring for better error handling
- Better for production use with non-English languages

### Usage Examples
```bash
# System prompt in English, but AI can respond in other languages when requested
User (English): "Please respond in German from now on"
AI (German): "Gerne! Ab jetzt spreche ich auf Deutsch mit dir."

# User must change recognition language in settings to speak German
User: (Changes settings to de-DE, then speaks German)
"Erzähl mir einen Witz"
AI: "Gerne! Hier ist ein Witz für dich..."
```

### Customizing the System Prompt

The default system prompt is optimized following OpenAI's [Realtime API Prompting Guide](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/realtime_prompting_guide). It includes:

- **Structured sections** - Role, Personality, Tools, Instructions for better model understanding
- **Sample phrases** - Consistent greetings, acknowledgments, and closings
- **Variety rules** - Prevents repetitive responses ("I see" | "Got it" | "Understood")
- **Tool integration** - Natural tool usage without explicit announcements
- **Physical embodiment** - First-person perspective as the robot

**To customize:**
1. Edit the system prompt in `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` (search for `default_system_prompt`)
2. Or modify it dynamically in Settings → System Prompt within the app
3. Follow the [Realtime Prompting Guide](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/realtime_prompting_guide) for best practices

**Key tips from the guide:**
- Use bullets over paragraphs for clarity
- Guide with specific examples
- Capitalize important rules for emphasis
- Add conversation flow states for complex interactions

### Key Configuration Files
- `local.properties.example` - API key template
- `app/build.gradle` - Build configuration and key injection
- `app/src/main/assets/jokes.json` - Joke database

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Not connected to server"
- Check your OpenAI or Azure OpenAI API key and endpoint
- Verify internet connectivity
- For Azure: Ensure the deployment name matches your Azure setup

#### "Vision analysis not available"
- Vision works automatically with gpt-realtime model
- For Groq alternative: Add GROQ_API_KEY to `local.properties`
- Check camera permissions and robot focus

#### "Feature requires API key"
- Each feature shows helpful setup instructions
- Add the corresponding API key to `local.properties`
- Rebuild and reinstall the app

#### Navigation Issues

**"No map available for navigation"**
- Create an environment map first using "Create a map"
- Guide Pepper through the room completely
- Finish the mapping process with "Finish the map"

**"Location not found"** 
- The AI now suggests available locations automatically
- Check spelling and pronunciation of location names
- Use the suggested location names from the AI

**"Mapping timeout"**
- Ensure room has good lighting and visual features
- Avoid rooms with mostly blank walls or mirrors
- Try mapping smaller sections of large rooms
- Check for obstacles blocking Pepper's movement

**"High precision vs standard locations"**
- Locations saved during active mapping are most accurate
- Locations saved after mapping are less precise but still functional
- For best results, save important locations during the mapping process

**"My saved locations disappeared"**
- Creating a new map automatically deletes all existing locations
- This prevents navigation errors caused by incompatible coordinate systems
- Each map creates its own coordinate system, making old locations invalid
- Simply re-save your important locations after creating the new map

## 🗺️ Map Visualization

### Map Preview Overlay
The app provides a **visual map preview** that shows the created environment map along with all saved locations in real-time.

#### How to Access
- **Tap the navigation icon** (📍) in the top toolbar to toggle the map preview
- **Overlay appears** in the top-right corner as a 320x240dp floating window
- **Tap again** to hide the preview

#### Visual Features
- **Environment Map** - Shows the actual mapped room layout as generated by Pepper's sensors
- **Saved Locations** - Displays all saved locations as **cyan-colored markers** with labels
- **Real-time Status** - Shows current navigation state:
  - *"No Map Available"* - No map has been created yet
  - *"Localizing..."* - Pepper is determining its position within the map
  - *"Map Loaded"* - Map is ready but robot not yet localized
  - *"Map Ready - No Locations"* - Map active but no locations saved
  - *Live view* - When localized, shows map with location markers

#### Use Cases
- **Location Overview** - See all saved locations at a glance
- **Navigation Planning** - Visually plan which locations to navigate to
- **Map Verification** - Confirm the mapped area covers desired spaces
- **Location Management** - Visual feedback when saving new locations
- **Debugging** - Verify mapping and localization status

#### Technical Details
- **Custom MapPreviewView** - Purpose-built Android custom view component
- **QiSDK Integration** - Uses Pepper's native map bitmap generation
- **Dynamic Updates** - Automatically refreshes when locations are added/removed
- **Optimized Rendering** - Efficient drawing with proper scaling and anti-aliasing

## 💬 Advanced Chat Interface

### Function Call Transparency
The chat interface provides **complete transparency** into AI function calling with professional expandable UI elements.

#### Function Call Cards
- **Expandable Design** - Each function call appears as a collapsible card in the chat
- **Status Indicators** - Visual status with ✅ (completed) or ⏳ (pending) icons
- **Function Icons** - Unique emoji icons for each tool (🌐 search, 🌤️ weather, 👁️ vision, etc.)
- **Summary View** - Condensed description when collapsed
- **Detailed View** - Full arguments and results when expanded

#### Interactive Elements
- **Tap to Expand** - Click any function call card to toggle detailed view
- **Smooth Animations** - Professional rotate animations for expand/collapse arrows  
- **JSON Formatting** - Properly formatted and readable JSON for arguments and results
- **Real-time Updates** - Function result appears automatically when operation completes

#### Transparency Benefits
- **Debugging Aid** - See exactly what parameters were sent to each function
- **Result Verification** - View complete API responses and tool outputs
- **Learning Tool** - Understand how AI decides to use different functions
- **Trust Building** - Complete visibility into AI decision-making process

### Vision Photo Display
When vision analysis is performed, photos are automatically displayed in the chat with interactive features.

#### Photo Integration
- **Automatic Capture** - Photos appear immediately when vision analysis starts
- **Thumbnail View** - Compact 220dp preview images in chat flow
- **Quality Optimization** - Efficiently sized thumbnails for smooth scrolling
- **Context Placement** - Photos appear exactly where vision analysis was requested

#### Full-Screen Viewing
- **Tap to Expand** - Click any photo thumbnail to view in full-screen overlay
- **High Resolution** - Full overlay displays up to 1024x1024 resolution
- **Overlay Interface** - Clean, distraction-free viewing experience  
- **Easy Dismissal** - Tap anywhere on overlay to return to chat

#### Professional Features
- **Session Management** - Photos are cleaned up automatically when session ends
- **Memory Optimization** - Efficient bitmap handling prevents memory leaks
- **File Path Storage** - Photos remain accessible throughout the conversation
- **Seamless Integration** - Photos and function calls work together in chat flow

### Logging
The app provides detailed logs for debugging:
```bash
# View all logs
adb logcat | grep -E "(ChatActivity|ApiKeyManager|ToolExecutor)"

# View navigation logs specifically
adb logcat | grep -E "(MovementController|ToolExecutor.*navigate|ToolRegistry.*location)"

# View mapping logs
adb logcat | grep -E "(LocalizeAndMap|mapping|create_environment_map)"
```
