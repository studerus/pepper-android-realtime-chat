## 🗺️ Navigation Workflow

### Complete Setup Process

#### 1. Create Environment Map
```bash
User: "Create a map of this room"
Robot: "I have started mapping. I have cleared 3 existing locations (printer, kitchen, entrance) since they would be invalid with the new map coordinate system. Guide me through the room..."
```

**Note**: Creating a new map automatically deletes all existing saved locations since they become invalid with the new coordinate system.

#### 2. Guide Pepper Through the Room
```bash
User: "Move forward 2 meters"
User: "Turn right 90 degrees"  
User: "Move forward 1 meter"
# Continue exploring all areas you want mapped
```

#### 3. Save Important Locations
```bash
User: "Save this location as printer"
Robot: "Saved location 'printer' with high precision during mapping"

User: "Save this location as kitchen" 
Robot: "Saved location 'kitchen' with high precision during mapping"
```

#### 4. Finish Mapping
```bash
User: "Finish the map"
Robot: "Map completed and saved successfully. Ready for navigation!"
```

#### 5. Navigate to Saved Locations
```bash
User: "Go to the printer"
Robot: "Navigating to printer... I have arrived at printer."

User: "Navigate to kitchen"
Robot: "Navigating to kitchen (high-precision location)..."
```

### Smart Location Recognition
The AI automatically knows all available locations and can suggest corrections:

```bash
User: "Go to Tür"
Robot: "I have these locations: Türe, Kitchen, Printer. Did you mean 'Türe'?"

User: "Yes, Türe" 
Robot: "Navigating to Türe..."
```

### Key Features
- **🎯 High-Precision Locations**: Saved during mapping for maximum accuracy
- **🧠 Intelligent Suggestions**: AI suggests similar location names
- **📍 Persistent Storage**: Locations survive app restarts within the same map
- **⚡ Dynamic Updates**: AI knows new locations immediately
- **🛡️ Error Prevention**: No "location not found" errors
- **🗑️ Auto-Cleanup**: New maps automatically clear old locations to prevent confusion

## 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game

### How to Play
The AI opponent provides an interactive Tic Tac Toe experience with voice commands and visual feedback.

#### Starting a Game
```bash
User: "Let's play Tic Tac Toe"
Robot: "Great! Let's start a game of Tic Tac Toe. You are X, I am O."
# Game dialog opens automatically
```

#### Gameplay

### Key Configuration Files
- `local.properties.example` - API key template
- `app/build.gradle` - Build configuration and key injection
- `app/src/main/assets/jokes.json` - Joke database

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Not connected to server"
- Check your Azure OpenAI API key and endpoint
- Verify internet connectivity
- Ensure the deployment name matches your Azure setup

#### "Vision analysis not available"
- Add GROQ_API_KEY to `local.properties`
- Rebuild the app after adding keys
- Check camera permissions

#### "Feature requires API key"
- Each feature shows helpful setup instructions
- Add the corresponding API key to `local.properties`
- Rebuild and reinstall the app

#### Navigation Issues

**"No map available for navigation"**
- Create an environment map first using "Create a map"
- Guide Pepper through the room completely
- Finish the mapping process with "Finish the map"

**"Location not found"** 
- The AI now suggests available locations automatically
- Check spelling and pronunciation of location names
- Use the suggested location names from the AI

**"Mapping timeout"**
- Ensure room has good lighting and visual features
- Avoid rooms with mostly blank walls or mirrors
- Try mapping smaller sections of large rooms
- Check for obstacles blocking Pepper's movement

**"High precision vs standard locations"**
- Locations saved during active mapping are most accurate
- Locations saved after mapping are less precise but still functional
- For best results, save important locations during the mapping process

**"My saved locations disappeared"**
- Creating a new map automatically deletes all existing locations
- This prevents navigation errors caused by incompatible coordinate systems
- Each map creates its own coordinate system, making old locations invalid
- Simply re-save your important locations after creating the new map

### Logging
The app provides detailed logs for debugging:
```bash
# View all logs
adb logcat | grep -E "(ChatActivity|ApiKeyManager|ToolExecutor)"

# View navigation logs specifically
adb logcat | grep -E "(MovementController|ToolExecutor.*navigate|ToolRegistry.*location)"

# View mapping logs
adb logcat | grep -E "(LocalizeAndMap|mapping|create_environment_map)"
```
